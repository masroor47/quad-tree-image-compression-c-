# Quad Tree Image Compression

This project is actually an assignment for CS 323 Design and Analysis of Algorithms. I'm not in that class, my friend is, but I wanted to speed-run it in C++ (even though the assignment was to build it in Java) to show that the projects aren't that hard and students struggling is due to a skill issue.

I succeeded in writing it in the short amount of time that I made the bet for.

## How to run

Have a system that has g++ or clang++. From the root of the project, run the following:

```bash
% make
% ./bin/main ./data/img1 outFile.txt logFile.txt
```

Then, inspect the outFile and logFile and see that it does indeed work.
